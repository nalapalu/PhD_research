## Project Title:
Model calculations of the contribution of tropospheric SO2 to the stratospheric aerosol layer

## Overview:
This research project aims to quantify the amount of sulfur dioxide (SO2) entering the stratosphere during volcanically quiescent periods and its associated uncertainties. The study focuses on understanding the contribution of SO2 to the stratospheric aerosol layer, which has significant implications for stratospheric chemistry, Earth's radiative balance, and geo-engineering. 

To achieve this goal, a comprehensive modeling approach was employed using the ATLAS (Advanced Treatment of Aerosols) chemistry and transport model. The study involved numerous sensitivity runs to assess the impact of limited knowledge of the underlying processes on the results. The main source regions contributing SO2 to the stratosphere were identified, as well as the types of emissions sources at the surface, including both natural and anthropogenic sources. 

The project also aimed to compare the model results with other existing models and observational data sets, such as the POSIDON flight mission. This comparison will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the uncertainties associated with estimating stratospheric SO2 input. 

## Objectives:
- What are the source regions near the surface which contribute SO2 to the stratospheric aerosol layer?
- What is the contribution of tropospheric SO2 to the stratospheric aerosol layer? How do the results from the ATLAS model compare to results of other observational and model data?
- What are the uncertainties in the parameters and parameterizations of the ATLAS model and how does it affect the transport and chemistry of tropospheric SO2?
- What is the effect of ENSO on the transport of SO2? What are the differences in sources, SO2 burden and sensitivities during the El Ni˜no, La Ni˜na and normal years?
## Data Used:
1. **TRMM PR (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Precipitation Radar) data products:**
   - 2A25: Spatial resolution 0.05° x 0.05°, vertical resolution 0.25 km.
   - 3B42: Spatial resolution 0.25° x 0.25°, temporal resolution 3 hours.
   - Period of data: 16 years (1998–2013), Version 7.

2. **ERA-5 Reanalysis data:**
   - Variables: Total column water vapor, temperature, relative humidity, vertical wind velocity.
   - Spatial resolution: 0.25° x 0.25°; temporal resolution 1 hour.

3. **Sea Surface Temperature Data:**
   - Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST).
   - Spatial resolution: 0.25° x 0.25°; temporal resolution 1 day.

## Study Region:
- Arabian Sea (AS): 8°–20° N, 63°–72° E
- Bay of Bengal (BOB): 8°–21° N, 83°–92° E

## Key Findings:
- **Vertical Structure of Precipitation:**
  - Higher occurrence of shallow rainfall observed below 4 km altitude during dry spells, particularly evident over the Arabian Sea (AS) and Bay of Bengal (BOB) during the Northeast Monsoon (NEM).
  - Reflectivity occurrence shows a unimodal distribution in NEM and a bimodal distribution in SWM, indicating increased shallow rainfall occurrences transitioning from SWM to NEM over BOB.
  
- **Storm Height Distribution:**
  - Predominance of shallow rain indicated by a peak at 3 km altitude over the AS.
  - Stratiform rain occurrence marked by a peak at 6 km altitude.
  - Deep systems observed more frequently during wet spells over both seas.

- **Rainfall Oscillations:**
  - Monsoon rainfall over India exhibits three distinct time scales of oscillations:
    - Short-term (3–8 days): linked to synoptic-scale activities.
    - Intermediate-term (10–20 days): northward propagation of rainy systems.
    - Long-term (30–60 days): northwestward propagation, correlated to large-scale atmospheric and oceanic processes such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO).

## Methodology:
- Analysis based on radar reflectivity profiles (CFADs - Contoured Frequency by Altitude Diagrams) using TRMM PR datasets.
- Temporal-spatial and spectral analyses of rainfall variations and oscillation modes.
- Comparative assessment of rainfall features between wet and dry spells, identified using defined rainfall thresholds.
